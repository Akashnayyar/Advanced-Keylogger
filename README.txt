------------------Advanced Keylogger----------------------

It's an advanced keylogger that sends the victim's information 
(keystrokes, system info, clipboard information, recorded audio file, system's screenshot) 
to the attacker's email.

NOTE: I have made this tool only for educational purposes.

Points to remember:--------------

1) I have used PyCharm to create this Advanced_Keylogger.

2) It requires some python modules, so install those modules. I'll put all modules names in a file named required modules.

3) I have used environment variables to input my email and passwords for security reasons. You assign an email address directly to the variable.

4) Change the file_path variable as per your file location.

5) This tool sends you all information in one email as attachments.

Advice: Use your bogus or extra email id in a tool.
